         <p>Kollam is a city in the state of Kerala, on India's Malabar Coast. Itâ€™s known as a trade hub and for its beaches, like lively Kollam and secluded Thirumullavaram. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Police Museum has artifacts tracing the history of the police force. Nearby, Ashtamudi Lake is a gateway to the Kerala backwaters, a network of waterways rich with vegetation. The striped 1902 Tangasseri Lighthouse has ocean view.Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. The Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in trade at the port of Kollam for millennia.[14] As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.[15][16] Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam. In the ninth century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin.[17] Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St Thomas as well as one of the 10 oldest mosques believed to be found by Malik Deenar in Kerala.
